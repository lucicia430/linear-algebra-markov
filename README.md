No-code case study using Markov chains to model customer movement and steady-state.
This is a no-code Markov chain case study that models customer movement across states (Browse → Add → Purchase → Churn). I explain how the transition matrix shows next-step probabilities and how the steady state estimates long-run distribution. The goal is clear communication for decisions—spot the biggest leak (often Add→Purchase) and propose a practical experiment (pricing or UX). See Markov_Chains_Case_Study.pdf for the full write-up.
